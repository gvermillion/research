Each file N.mod gives the positions for the beryl atoms and water molecule, with the water molecule rotated N*(pi/150). The comment to the right of each set of coordinates gives the atoms type, wherein the water atoms have a 'W' suffix. Positions are Cartesian. 

dry.mod contains no water molecule

This dir contains fifty rotations between [0,pi/3]
